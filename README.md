# Project Setup Guide

## Prerequisites
Before building the project, you need to install the required third-party library.

## Steps
1. Go to the root directory of the project.
2. Create a folder named `3rd`
3. Download the [mcl library](https://github.com/herumi/mcl) and place it inside the `3rd` folder.
   The directory structure should look like:
   ProjectRoot/
   ├── 3rd/
   │   └── mcl/   (cloned mcl repository)
   ├── src/
   ├── CMakeLists.txt
   └── ...
